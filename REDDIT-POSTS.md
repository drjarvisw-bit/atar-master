## Version 1 — The "I built something" angle

**Title:** I built a free Methods practice platform with 1700+ questions and every past exam (2016-2024) — looking for beta testers

**Body:**

Hey r/vce,

I've been working on a Methods study platform called ATAR Master and it's finally at a point where I'd love some real feedback from actual Methods students.

**What it is:**
- A skill tree that takes you from Year 8 foundations all the way to VCE exam level — so you can actually see where your gaps are
- 1700+ practice questions organised by topic
- Every Methods exam from 2016-2024, fully worked
- Streak system and progress tracking to keep you consistent (think Duolingo but for Methods)

**What's free:**
- The full skill tree and all practice questions
- 2018-2020 past exams are completely free to access

It's still in beta so there'll be rough edges — that's exactly why I'm posting here. I genuinely want to know what works, what doesn't, and what you wish it had.

If you're doing Methods this year (or next) and want to check it out: [atarmaster.com](https://atarmaster.com)

Happy to answer any questions. And if something's broken or annoying, please tell me — that's the whole point of beta testing lol.

## Version 2 — The "study tip / resource share" angle

**Title:** Free resource for Methods — 1700+ practice questions organised in a skill tree (beta, looking for feedback)

**Body:**

For anyone doing Methods — I wanted to share a platform I've been working on that might actually be useful for your study.

It's called ATAR Master and the idea is pretty simple: instead of randomly doing practice questions and hoping for the best, it maps out every Methods skill from Year 8 basics to exam-level stuff in a skill tree. You work through it and can actually see what you've mastered vs what needs work.

Some specifics:
- 1700+ practice questions across all topics
- Complete past exams from 2016-2024
- Progress tracking and streaks to keep you accountable
- 2018-2020 exams are free for everyone

It's currently in beta which means: (a) it's free to try, and (b) I'm actively looking for feedback. If you use it and think "this would be way better if..." — that's exactly the kind of thing I want to hear.

Check it out at [atarmaster.com](https://atarmaster.com) if you're interested.

No pressure obviously, just thought it might help some of you. Good luck with Methods this year 🤙

## Version 3 — The "exam prep" angle (best for mid-year / closer to exams)

**Title:** Every Methods exam from 2016-2024 in one place + 1700 practice questions — free beta

**Body:**

If you're anything like me, you've probably spent way too long hunting for past Methods exams and organising practice by topic. I got frustrated with that and ended up building something.

ATAR Master has:
- All Methods exams from 2016 to 2024
- 1700+ practice questions organised in a skill tree (not just random Qs — it actually maps your progress from foundations to exam-ready)
- Streak tracking so you don't fall off studying for a week and pretend it didn't happen

The 2018-2020 exams are completely free, and since it's still in beta, I'm letting people try everything while I gather feedback.

Honestly just want to know if it's actually helpful or if I'm building something nobody asked for lol. If you try it and have thoughts (good or bad), I'd really appreciate hearing them.

Good luck to everyone doing Methods this year — you've got this.
